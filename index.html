  <p style="text-align:center;font-family:URW Chancery L, cursive;font-size:100%;"> Hi there and welcome to my first webpage! If you could not already tell, my name is Amy! There are a lot of things that I could tell you about myself but the first thing that I think you deserve to know is that I love to play sports. The second thing would be my dog Smoke but we will get to that later. I have played a variety of sports in my lifetime. I played softball and soccer when I was younger and tennis in high school. I swam a little bit in between the time after graduating high school and entering college. I do not know if you would necessarily count that towards my list of sports that I have played but I like to think that it counts. I picked up playing volleyball during my time in college and I have come to love it more than any other sport that I have played thus far. I started playing because I joined a club my freshman year and they had subgroups that allowed their members to play sports if they wanted. I had played beach volleyball before but I had zero experience with actual court volleyball. Lucky for me, the people that I played with were super supportive and helpful in teaching me how to play. Now 2 years have gone by and I am still playing for the club and loving every second of it!</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive;font-size:250%;text-align:center;">My Dog Smoke!</h2>
  <p style="font-family:URW Chancery L, cursive;font-size:100%;text-align:center;">Now onto the second thing that you should know about me: my dog, Smoke. I got him October 2017 so it has been about a year and some change. He is the very best thing that could have ever happened to me. He is my baby boy, child, best friend and any other word that you could think of that would describe a loving companion. There were some ups and down with training and being a student but at the end of the day, I love my dog with all my heart and would not have it any other way. Just a little bit of background on the kind of pup that he is, Smoke is a purebred Rottweiler. He is a year and 2 months old and has about 6 other siblings. I keep in contact with one of his sister owner but other than that, I do not really know where the others of the litter went. All I do know is that Smoke is a heaven sent. Here are some pictures of him from when he was a puppy!</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive;font-size:250%;text-align:center;">Favorite Study Music</h2>
   <p style="font-family:URW Chancery L, cursive;font-size:100%;text-align:center;">If you ever want some good white noise type music to study to, try listening to the Studio Ghibli soundtrack that can be found on YouTube. I have also put an easy way to access the video right below. This is the type of music that I will casually listen to while I study. I do this so that there is just enough noise so my mind does not start to derail and lose focus but catchy enough for me to find entertaining enough to continue listening to. It is weird because normally I am not a big fan of listening to music while trying to study or do work because I get too distracted, but there is just something so soothing about Studio Ghibli soundtracks. It also helps that there are not any words in the music that could possibly jumble with my thought processes. I hope that you will enjoy this just as much as I do!</p>
